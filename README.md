# Crypto Meme Coin Predictive Analysis

## Introduction

This project aims to build a predictive analysis model for a crypto meme coin, leveraging historical price data, market indicators, and sentiment analysis. By utilizing various data science and machine learning techniques, this model will forecast future price movements, providing valuable insights for traders and enthusiasts.

## Project Overview

1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical price data, market indicators, and sentiment data from various sources.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean, normalize, and engineer features from the collected data.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualize data to understand trends and correlations.
4. **Model Building**: Develop and train predictive models using machine learning algorithms.
5. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using appropriate metrics.
6. **Advanced Modeling** (Optional): Implement advanced techniques such as deep learning and sentiment analysis.
7. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the model as a web service for real-time predictions. (Future Improvement)
